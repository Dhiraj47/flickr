# flickr
This app is just a clone of flickr.com(Not good as real one), but this app contains some features that real flickr.com doesn't have and i.e. an admin can top 10 likes and comments on a pic and number of user like, upload and many things in a graph.

NOTE:
* You wil need XAMPP or(WAMPP) to run this app.
* Just copy the app folder in any folder(if you have installed XAMPP then copy the whole file into "C:/xampp/htdocs and then in any folder")
* Then make a database of name gallery(or not then change the database name in db_connection.php file) using xampp.
* After that import the table (i.e. gallery.sql) into that database, from ./flickr/files/gallery.sql.

Thats it. after that just run your program from your localhost.
